# Team-Profile-Generator

* This is an website I created utilizing HTML and JavaScript. When launching the app the user is prompted to input team members information such as their name - their title - their ID & # and their email/phone if applicable alongside github username. 

* This program was created utilzing OOP (Object Oriented Programming concepts). It is run using Node.js and utilizes inquirer as well as jest. The program also followed TDD (Test Driven Development) After inputting all the user data, it is then displayed as an HTML website with the team memebers organized description as well as their other information. 


This is a quick video as to how it works.
